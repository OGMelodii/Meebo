# Introducing the "What Did You Expect?" Bot or The "MEE6" Destroyer

Are you fed up with manually banning, muting, and kicking people on Discord like it’s your full-time gig? 

Do you feel like a digital babysitter, endlessly sifting through the chaotic mess while chronically online folks argue about the merits of pineapple on pizza, as if that debate hasn’t been beaten to death by countless memes? 

This bot is designed to liberate you from the existential dread of moderating an online community, allowing you to finally focus on more important things—like judging other people’s choices while your own life crumbles like a stale cookie under the weight of bad decisions.

## What This Bot Can Do

Here’s a glimpse into the bot’s impressive arsenal of commands that could make even the most power-hungry Discord mods weep into their Cheez-Its.

- **!ban @user**: Bans a user. (Because sometimes, the only thing they contribute is a relentless stream of bad puns that could make a dad joke enthusiast weep. Nobody needs that negativity in their life. You’re not running a comedy club, so why put up with amateur hour? You deserve better!)

- **!unban @user**: Unbans a user by mention. (For when you realize they weren’t as insufferable as you thought—oops! Or maybe you just want to give them another chance to ruin your day. Either way, enjoy the impending chaos and remember, you asked for it!)

- **!kick @user**: Kicks a user. (A gentle nudge out the door—more like a shove, really. It’s not like they’ll miss your server; they’ll just find another place to annoy everyone!)

- **!mute @user**: Mutes a user indefinitely. (Silence is golden, and this user is now on permanent mute until you decide to unmute them. Enjoy the sweet sound of nothingness!)

- **!unmute @user**: Unmutes a user. (For those brave enough to let them speak again—proceed with caution. Remember, you’ve muted them for a reason!)

- **!warn @user**: Warns and mutes a user for 5 minutes. (A gentle reminder for the most annoying of the bunch. “Congratulations! You’ve unlocked ‘Most Likely to Ruin a Server.’”)

- **!serverinfo**: Displays server information. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably just a bunch of people debating the merits of cats vs. dogs while living in their parents’ basements.)

- **!info**: Lists all available commands. (Perfect for those who can’t be bothered to read.)

- **!userinfo @user**: Displays information about a user. (For when you need a reminder of who’s been a pain.)

- **!muteall**: Mutes all members. (Finally, some peace and quiet! Enjoy the sound of crickets.)

- **!unmuteall**: Unmutes all members. (Brace yourself—chaos is about to return.)

- **!promote @user (role)**: Promotes a user to a specified role. (Good luck explaining that to those who thought they had power.)

- **!demote @user (role)**: Demotes a user from a specified role. (Because they were never fit to wear that crown, anyway.)

- **!chanpro @user (CHANNELID)**: Sets a user as channel producer. (For those who might actually know what they’re doing—don’t get your hopes up.)

- **!depro @user (CHANNELID)**: Removes a user as channel producer. (No hard feelings… until the next server meeting.)

- **!setowner [user_id]**: Changes the OWNER_ID to the specified user. (Because sometimes you just need to hand over the keys.)

- **!getowner**: Displays the current OWNER_ID. (For when you forget who’s in charge.)

- **!resetowner**: Resets the OWNER_ID to the server owner. (Because sometimes it’s best to return to square one.)

- **!slowdown (DURATION) (CHANNEL_ID)**: Slows down message sending in the specified channel. (For when the chaos needs to be reigned in, if only temporarily.)

## Installation

Installing this bot is as easy as ignoring the pleas of Discord mods trying to enforce rules nobody cares about.

1. Download the bot files from the repository (you know how to do that, right? If not, maybe take a moment to reassess your life choices).
2. Go outside and touch grass. (Yes, you heard that right! Don’t worry, the digital world will still be there waiting for your return.)
3. Run the setup script and watch it install like magic—assuming you remember how to run scripts and don’t accidentally delete your entire server in the process.
4. Take a moment to reflect on your life choices. (This step is optional, but we highly recommend it.)
5. Configure the settings according to your needs. (This step requires some thought, so good luck with that—no pressure!)
6. Get a girlfriend (or boyfriend, we don’t judge). (Because nothing says “I’m ready for chaos” like having someone to share the madness with!)
7. Buy a stress ball or something equally squishy, just in case things get out of hand. (You might need it when the drama hits the fan!)
8. Add the bot to your server and watch as it transforms your server into a semi-organized chaos arena!

## Release Information

**Release Date**: never

We know what you’re thinking: “When will this glorious monstrosity of a bot actually be available?” Well, sit tight, because that’s about as predictable as a cat deciding whether or not it wants to be petted.

We’re currently knee-deep in code, caffeine, and existential dread, trying to whip this thing into shape. If you think your life is a hot mess, just wait until you see our development process—it’s like watching a toddler try to build a skyscraper out of Lego bricks while blindfolded. Fun? Yes. Effective? Not so much.

As for the release date, it’s more elusive than your last good decision. We could throw out a date, but let’s be real: it would probably end up being as accurate as a fortune cookie prediction. So, keep your expectations low and your sarcasm high—because it’s going to be a wild ride.

We promise we’re not just sitting around watching paint dry (although that sounds oddly relaxing compared to what we’re doing). We’re actually working hard to ensure this bot is both chaotic and slightly functional. It’s like trying to bake a cake while riding a unicycle—sure, it’s possible, but don’t be surprised if we end up with a flour explosion and a trip to the emergency room.

In the meantime, feel free to daydream about all the glorious chaos that awaits you when this bot finally launches. And if you find yourself losing hope, remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a bot designed to unleash digital mayhem.

So, grab your snacks, brace yourself for disappointment, and keep checking back for updates. Who knows? You might just be the lucky one to witness the birth of a legend—or at least a really entertaining disaster!

# Introducing the "What Did You Expect?" Bot

Are you tired of manually banning, muting, and kicking people on Discord like it's your full-time job? Are you exhausted from dealing with the endless stream of nonsense that seems to flow through every server? Well, **you're in luck!** The "What Did You Expect?" bot is coming very soon—though who knows when? Maybe in a week, a month, or when Discord mods finally learn what a proper banhammer looks like! It’s the kind of bot that makes you wonder why you ever bothered doing any of it yourself. 

## What This Bot Can Do

Here's a glimpse into the bot's impressive arsenal of commands that could make even the most power-hungry Discord mods weep with envy (or jealousy because you’ve finally found a bot that can do their job better than they can). These commands are designed to make your life easier, more organized, and just a little more fun—because let’s face it, dealing with people online is a full-time job that nobody asked for: 

- **`!ban @user`**: Bans a user. (Because sometimes, the only contribution they make is bad puns, and we all know the world is better off without them.)
- **`!unban @user`**: Unbans a user by mention. (For when you realize they weren’t as annoying as you thought—oops!)
- **`!kick @user`**: Kicks a user. (A gentle nudge out the door… or a shove, really—who’s keeping track?)
- **`!mute @user`**: Mutes a user for 5 minutes. (Just long enough to remind them that their opinions aren’t mandatory, and that silence is golden.)
- **`!unmute @user`**: Unmutes a user. (For those brave enough to let them speak again—proceed with caution.)
- **`!warn @user`**: Warns and mutes a user for 5 minutes. (Because a gentle warning is all some people need before they set off the chaos.)
- **`!serverinfo`**: Displays server information. (Spoiler: It’s probably just a bunch of people chronically online debating pineapple on pizza while living in their parents' basement.)
- **`!info`**: Lists all available commands. (Perfect for those who can’t be bothered to read; we know you’re out there!)
- **`!userinfo @user`**: Displays information about a user. (For when you need a reminder of who’s been a pain, because sometimes you forget who to avoid.)
- **`!muteall`**: Mutes all members. (Finally, some peace and quiet! Enjoy the sound of crickets while the mods sob over their lost power.)
- **`!unmuteall`**: Unmutes all members. (Brace yourself—chaos is about to return, and we know you’ll regret this in five minutes.)
- **`!promote @user (role)`**: Promotes a user to a specified role. (Good luck explaining that to the ones who thought they had the power; this should be entertaining.)
- **`!demote @user (role)`**: Demotes a user from a specified role. (Because they were never fit to wear that crown, anyway—better luck next time.)
- **`!chanpro @user (CHANNELID)`**: Sets a user as channel producer. (For those rare souls who might actually know what they’re doing—don’t get your hopes up.)
- **`!depro @user (CHANNELID)`**: Removes a user as channel producer. (No hard feelings... until the next server meeting, where we will discuss your incompetence.)
- **`!lock (CHANNELID)`**: Locks a channel. (Perfect for when the chatter gets too ridiculous—like a late-night infomercial you can’t look away from.)
- **`!unlock (CHANNELID)`**: Unlocks a channel. (Let the madness resume! You’ve made your bed; now lie in it.)
- **`!message (your_content)`**: Sends a message as OGMelodii. (Because you need someone to say the things you can’t, like reminding your friend that they still owe you money.)

## Installation

Installing this bot is as easy as ignoring the pleas of Discord mods trying to enforce rules nobody cares about. Just follow these steps: 

1. **Clone this repository**: Just like the last time you told your friends you’d be right back… we all know how that went. 
2. **Install the necessary packages**: We assume you can Google this; if not, how did you get this far? 
3. **Run the bot with your token**: Good luck keeping it safe from the drama queens of the server; they’re lurking around every corner!

## Disclaimer

Use this bot wisely; even the best intentions can turn into chaos faster than a Discord mod can threaten a ban. Remember, while this bot is designed to make your life easier, it’s also here to serve the purpose of highlighting the sheer absurdity of moderating an online community. It’s like herding cats, only these cats think they’re the next big meme lord. So, are you ready to take the plunge? The "What Did You Expect?" bot is waiting for its moment to shine—just like the users who never log off and somehow think their presence matters! 

**Stay tuned for updates, and may your server be filled with more memes than mayhem!**

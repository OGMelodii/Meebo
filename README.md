# Introducing the "What Did You Expect?" Bot or The "MEE6" Destroyer

Are you fed up with manually banning, muting, and kicking people on Discord like it’s your full-time gig? Do you feel like a digital babysitter, endlessly sifting through the chaotic mess while chronically online folks argue about the merits of pineapple on pizza, as if that debate hasn't been beaten to death by countless memes? Well, **you’re in luck!** The "What Did You Expect?" bot is coming very soon—though who knows when? Maybe in a week, a month, or when Discord mods finally figure out how to use a banhammer instead of a rubber mallet! This bot is designed to liberate you from the existential dread of moderating an online community, allowing you to finally focus on more important things—like judging other people’s choices while your own life crumbles like a stale cookie under the weight of bad decisions.

## What This Bot Can Do

Here’s a glimpse into the bot’s impressive arsenal of commands that could make even the most power-hungry Discord mods weep into their Cheez-Its. These commands are designed to save your sanity and let you bask in the glorious chaos of the internet—because let’s face it, dealing with people online is like herding cats in a tornado, and nobody signed up for that circus. You might as well get a front-row seat to the spectacle while the rest of us take bets on who will implode first.

- **`!ban @user`**: Bans a user. (Because sometimes, the only thing they contribute is a relentless stream of bad puns that could make a dad joke enthusiast weep. Nobody needs that negativity in their life. You’re not running a comedy club, so why put up with amateur hour? You deserve better!)

- **`!unban @user`**: Unbans a user by mention. (For when you realize they weren’t as insufferable as you thought—oops! Or maybe you just want to give them another chance to ruin your day. Either way, enjoy the impending chaos and remember, you asked for it! Just don’t act surprised when they revert back to their annoying ways faster than you can say “give them another shot.”)

- **`!kick @user`**: Kicks a user. (A gentle nudge out the door—more like a shove, really. It’s not like they’ll miss your server; they’ll just find another place to annoy everyone! And let’s be honest, they probably won’t even notice until they’re halfway through their next rant about the state of the universe. Good riddance!)

- **`!mute @user`**: Mutes a user for 5 minutes. (Just long enough for them to ponder their life choices. Maybe they’ll realize that their unsolicited opinions aren’t mandatory and the world will be a better place, but let’s be real—they’ll probably just whine about it in the next chat. Meanwhile, you can enjoy the peace and quiet, like a long-awaited vacation from the madness.)

- **`!unmute @user`**: Unmutes a user. (For those brave enough to let them speak again—proceed with caution. Remember, you’ve been warned! This could end in tears… and not just theirs. You might find yourself questioning your life choices as well. “What have I done to deserve this?”)

- **`!warn @user`**: Warns and mutes a user for 5 minutes. (Because a gentle reminder is all some people need before they hit that new level of annoying. “Congratulations! You’ve unlocked ‘Most Likely to Ruin a Server.’” You can almost hear the celebratory confetti falling, can’t you?)

- **`!serverinfo`**: Displays server information. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably just a bunch of people chronically online debating the merits of cats vs. dogs while living in their parents’ basements. Don’t worry; we won’t judge… much. Besides, we’re all just one bad meme away from losing our minds. Keep the emergency snacks nearby; you’re going to need them.)

- **`!info`**: Lists all available commands. (Perfect for those who can’t be bothered to read—like a guide for the terminally lazy. Seriously, we see you! If only there were a command to teach you basic reading skills. Maybe this bot could be your life coach instead?)

- **`!userinfo @user`**: Displays information about a user. (For when you need a reminder of who’s been a pain, because sometimes you forget who to avoid. “Oh right, it’s that guy again… great. Just what I needed today! Now I can prepare my mental defenses.”)

- **`!muteall`**: Mutes all members. (Finally, some peace and quiet! Enjoy the sound of crickets while the mods weep over their lost power. You’re a hero—who knew? Now you can finally hear yourself think… if only for a moment before the madness resumes.)

- **`!unmuteall`**: Unmutes all members. (Brace yourself—chaos is about to return, and you’ll definitely regret this in five minutes. But hey, you gave them a taste of silence; enjoy the sweet irony! You just can’t resist stirring the pot, can you?)

- **`!promote @user (role)`**: Promotes a user to a specified role. (Good luck explaining that to the ones who thought they had power; this should be entertaining. Get the popcorn ready for the inevitable meltdown! “Wait, I’m not an admin? What do you mean I can’t command the entire server?”)

- **`!demote @user (role)`**: Demotes a user from a specified role. (Because they were never fit to wear that crown, anyway. Better luck next time—just don’t cry about it in the public chat. Remember, it’s all in good fun… or is it? We can’t tell if you’re serious or just trying to entertain us at this point.)

- **`!chanpro @user (CHANNELID)`**: Sets a user as channel producer. (For those rare souls who might actually know what they’re doing—don’t get your hopes up. They’ll probably just mess it up spectacularly, and you’ll have front-row seats to the disaster. Buckle up; it’s going to be a bumpy ride!)

- **`!depro @user (CHANNELID)`**: Removes a user as channel producer. (No hard feelings… until the next server meeting, where we’ll discuss your incompetence. Good luck with that; you’ll need it, especially when you realize everyone’s silently judging you!)

- **`!lock (CHANNELID)`**: Locks a channel. (Perfect for when the chatter gets too ridiculous—like watching a train wreck you can’t look away from. Sometimes you just need to hit pause on the chaos and take a deep breath, even if it feels like your head is about to explode.)

- **`!unlock (CHANNELID)`**: Unlocks a channel. (Let the madness resume! You’ve made your bed; now lie in it. Good luck with that; you’ll definitely need some sage for the impending bad vibes. Just remember, you asked for this!)

- **`!message (your_content)`**: Sends a message as OGMelodii. (Because you need someone to say the things you can’t, like reminding your friend they still owe you money. It’s all about maintaining those crucial social contracts, even if it means throwing them under the bus for your own sanity!)

## Installation

Installing this bot is as easy as ignoring the pleas of Discord mods trying to enforce rules nobody cares about. Just follow these steps: 

1. **Download the bot files** from the repository (you know how to do that, right? If not, maybe take a moment to reassess your life choices before diving deeper into this rabbit hole).
   
2. **Run the setup script** and watch it install like magic—assuming you remember how to run scripts and don’t accidentally delete your entire server in the process. We believe in you… kind of. Just don’t call us when it all goes south!

3. **Configure the settings** according to your needs. This step requires some thought, so good luck with that—no pressure! Just remember, if you mess it up, it’s your fault! “How did I end up with this mess? Oh right, it’s because I didn’t follow the instructions.”

4. **Add the bot to your server** and watch as it transforms your server into a semi-organized chaos arena where nobody knows what’s going on but everyone pretends to. You’ll be the one standing in the corner, sipping your drink, while everything burns around you. And honestly, that’s where the fun is!

So, if you’re ready to embrace the madness and finally kick those annoying users to the curb without lifting a finger (well, maybe just a finger), keep an eye out for the "What Did You Expect?" bot! It’s coming soon—who knows when, but definitely before the next apocalypse! Buckle up, it’s going to be a bumpy ride through the hilariously chaotic world of Discord!

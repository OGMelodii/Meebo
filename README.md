# Introducing the "What Did You Expect?" Bot or The "MEE6" Destroyer
Are you fed up with manually banning, muting, and kicking people on Discord like it’s your full-time gig?

Do you feel like a digital babysitter, endlessly sifting through the chaotic mess while chronically online folks argue about the merits of pineapple on pizza, as if that debate hasn’t been beaten to death by countless memes?

This bot is designed to liberate you from the existential dread of moderating an online community, allowing you to finally focus on more important things—like judging other people’s choices while your own life crumbles like a stale cookie under the weight of bad decisions.

# What This Bot Can Do
Here’s a glimpse into the bot’s impressive arsenal of commands that could make even the most power-hungry Discord mods weep into their Cheez-Its.

These commands are designed to save your sanity and let you bask in the glorious chaos of the internet—because let’s face it, dealing with people online is like herding cats in a tornado, and nobody signed up for that circus.

You might as well get a front-row seat to the spectacle while the rest of us take bets on who will implode first.

# !ban @user: Bans a user.
(Because sometimes, the only thing they contribute is a relentless stream of bad puns that could make a dad joke enthusiast weep. Nobody needs that negativity in their life. You’re not running a comedy club, so why put up with amateur hour? You deserve better!)

# !unban @user: Unbans a user by mention.
(For when you realize they weren’t as insufferable as you thought—oops! Or maybe you just want to give them another chance to ruin your day. Either way, enjoy the impending chaos and remember, you asked for it! Just don’t act surprised when they revert back to their annoying ways faster than you can say “give them another shot.”)

# !kick @user: Kicks a user.
(A gentle nudge out the door—more like a shove, really. It’s not like they’ll miss your server; they’ll just find another place to annoy everyone! And let’s be honest, they probably won’t even notice until they’re halfway through their next rant about the state of the universe. Good riddance!)

# !mute @user: Mutes a user indefinitely.
(Silence is golden, and this user is now on permanent mute until you decide to unmute them. Finally, you can enjoy the sweet sound of nothingness without their constant interruptions—until you feel merciful enough to let them speak again!)

# !unmute @user: Unmutes a user.
(For those brave enough to let them speak again—proceed with caution. Remember, you’ve muted them for a reason, and their next outburst could make you regret your moment of leniency!)

# !warn @user: Warns and mutes a user for 5 minutes.
(Because a gentle reminder is all some people need before they hit that new level of annoying. “Congratulations! You’ve unlocked ‘Most Likely to Ruin a Server.’” You can almost hear the celebratory confetti falling, can’t you?)

# !serverinfo: Displays server information.
(Spoiler alert: It’s probably just a bunch of people chronically online debating the merits of cats vs. dogs while living in their parents’ basements. Don’t worry; we won’t judge… much. Besides, we’re all just one bad meme away from losing our minds. Keep the emergency snacks nearby; you’re going to need them.)

# !info: Lists all available commands.
(Perfect for those who can’t be bothered to read—like a guide for the terminally lazy. Seriously, we see you! If only there were a command to teach you basic reading skills. Maybe this bot could be your life coach instead?)

# !userinfo @user: Displays information about a user.
(For when you need a reminder of who’s been a pain, because sometimes you forget who to avoid. “Oh right, it’s that guy again… great. Just what I needed today! Now I can prepare my mental defenses.”)

# !muteall: Mutes all members.
(Finally, some peace and quiet! Enjoy the sound of crickets while the mods weep over their lost power. You’re a hero—who knew? Now you can finally hear yourself think… if only for a moment before the madness resumes.)

# !unmuteall: Unmutes all members.
(Brace yourself—chaos is about to return, and you’ll definitely regret this in five minutes. But hey, you gave them a taste of silence; enjoy the sweet irony! You just can’t resist stirring the pot, can you?)

# !promote @user (role): Promotes a user to a specified role.
(Good luck explaining that to the ones who thought they had power; this should be entertaining. Get the popcorn ready for the inevitable meltdown! “Wait, I’m not an admin? What do you mean I can’t command the entire server?”)

# !demote @user (role): Demotes a user from a specified role.
(Because they were never fit to wear that crown, anyway. Better luck next time—just don’t cry about it in the public chat. Remember, it’s all in good fun… or is it? We can’t tell if you’re serious or just trying to entertain us at this point.)

# !chanpro @user (CHANNELID): Sets a user as channel producer.
(For those rare souls who might actually know what they’re doing—don’t get your hopes up. They’ll probably just mess it up spectacularly, and you’ll have front-row seats to the disaster. Buckle up; it’s going to be a bumpy ride!)

# !depro @user (CHANNELID): Removes a user as channel producer.
(No hard feelings… until the next server meeting, where we’ll discuss your incompetence. Good luck with that; you’ll need it, especially when you realize everyone’s silently judging you!)

# !setowner [user_id]: Changes the OWNER_ID to the specified user.
(Because sometimes you just need to hand over the keys to someone else. Let’s see if they can handle the madness better than you did!)

# !getowner: Displays the current OWNER_ID.
(For when you forget who’s in charge around here—don’t worry, it happens to the best of us. Maybe you just need to remind everyone who’s really calling the shots!)

# !resetowner: Resets the OWNER_ID to the server owner.
(Because sometimes it’s best to return to square one and let the chaos unfold naturally under the original overlord’s rule.)

# Installation
Installing this bot is as easy as ignoring the pleas of Discord mods trying to enforce rules nobody cares about.

Just follow these steps:

Download the bot files from the repository (you know how to do that, right? If not, maybe take a moment to reassess your life choices before diving deeper into this rabbit hole).

Go outside and touch grass.
(Yes, you heard that right! Maybe get a sunburn while you’re at it; it’ll remind you what sunlight feels like. Don’t worry, the digital world will still be there waiting for your return.)

Run the setup script and watch it install like magic—assuming you remember how to run scripts and don’t accidentally delete your entire server in the process.
We believe in you… kind of. Just don’t call us when it all goes south!

Take a moment to reflect on your life choices.
(This step is optional, but we highly recommend it. Ask yourself: “How did I end up here?” Maybe ponder your life goals while you’re at it.)

Configure the settings according to your needs.
This step requires some thought, so good luck with that—no pressure! Just remember, if you mess it up, it’s your fault!
“How did I end up with this mess? Oh right, it’s because I didn’t follow the instructions.”

Get a girlfriend (or boyfriend, we don’t judge).
(Because nothing says “I’m ready for chaos” like having someone to share the madness with! And let’s be honest, you might need emotional support after unleashing this bot on your server.)

Buy a stress ball or something equally squishy, just in case things get out of hand.
(You might need it when the drama hits the fan, and trust us, it will!)

Add the bot to your server and watch as it transforms your server into a semi-organized chaos arena where nobody knows what’s going on!

# Release Information
Release Date: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

We know what you’re thinking: “When will this glorious monstrosity of a bot actually be available?” Well, sit tight, because that’s about as predictable as a cat deciding whether or not it wants to be petted.

We’re currently knee-deep in code, caffeine, and existential dread, trying to whip this thing into shape. If you think your life is a hot mess, just wait until you see our development process—it’s like watching a toddler try to build a skyscraper out of Lego bricks while blindfolded. Fun? Yes. Effective? Not so much.

As for the release date, it’s more elusive than your last good decision. We could throw out a date, but let’s be real: it would probably end up being as accurate as a fortune cookie prediction. So, keep your expectations low and your sarcasm high—because it’s going to be a wild ride.

We promise we’re not just sitting around watching paint dry (although that sounds oddly relaxing compared to what we’re doing). We’re actually working hard to ensure this bot is both chaotic and slightly functional. It’s like trying to bake a cake while riding a unicycle—sure, it’s possible, but don’t be surprised if we end up with a flour explosion and a trip to the emergency room.

In the meantime, feel free to daydream about all the glorious chaos that awaits you when this bot finally launches. And if you find yourself losing hope, remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a bot designed to unleash digital mayhem.

So, grab your snacks, brace yourself for disappointment, and keep checking back for updates. Who knows? You might just be the lucky one to witness the birth of a legend—or at least a really entertaining disaster!

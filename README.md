# Introducing the "What Did You Expect?" Bot

Are you fed up with manually banning, muting, and kicking people on Discord like it’s your full-time gig? Do you feel like a digital babysitter, sifting through the chaos while chronically online folks argue about the merits of pineapple on pizza? Well, **you’re in luck!** The "What Did You Expect?" bot is coming very soon—though who knows when? Maybe in a week, a month, or when Discord mods finally figure out how to use a banhammer instead of a rubber mallet! This bot is designed to liberate you from the existential dread of moderating an online community, so you can finally focus on more important things—like judging other people’s choices while your own life crumbles.

## What This Bot Can Do

Here’s a glimpse into the bot’s impressive arsenal of commands that could make even the most power-hungry Discord mods weep into their Cheez-Its. These commands are designed to save your sanity and let you bask in the glorious chaos of the internet—because let’s face it, dealing with people online is like herding cats in a tornado.

- **`!ban @user`**: Bans a user. (Because sometimes, the only thing they contribute is bad puns, and nobody needs that negativity in their life. You’re not running a comedy club, so why put up with amateur hour?)
- **`!unban @user`**: Unbans a user by mention. (For when you realize they weren’t as insufferable as you thought—oops! Or maybe you just want to give them another chance to ruin your day. Either way, enjoy the impending chaos!)
- **`!kick @user`**: Kicks a user. (A gentle nudge out the door—more like a shove, really. It’s not like they’ll miss your server; they’ll just find another place to pester people!)
- **`!mute @user`**: Mutes a user for 5 minutes. (Just long enough for them to ponder their life choices. Maybe they’ll realize that their unsolicited opinions aren’t mandatory, and the world will be a better place.)
- **`!unmute @user`**: Unmutes a user. (For those brave enough to let them speak again—proceed with caution. Remember, you’ve been warned!)
- **`!warn @user`**: Warns and mutes a user for 5 minutes. (Because a gentle reminder is all some people need before they hit that new level of annoying. “Congratulations! You’ve unlocked ‘Most Likely to Ruin a Server.’”)
- **`!serverinfo`**: Displays server information. (Spoiler alert: It’s probably just a bunch of people chronically online debating the merits of cats vs. dogs while living in their parents’ basements. Don’t worry; we won’t judge… much.)
- **`!info`**: Lists all available commands. (Perfect for those who can’t be bothered to read—like a guide for the terminally lazy. Seriously, we see you!)
- **`!userinfo @user`**: Displays information about a user. (For when you need a reminder of who’s been a pain, because sometimes you forget who to avoid. “Oh right, it’s that guy again… great.”)
- **`!muteall`**: Mutes all members. (Finally, some peace and quiet! Enjoy the sound of crickets while the mods weep over their lost power. You’re a hero—who knew?)
- **`!unmuteall`**: Unmutes all members. (Brace yourself—chaos is about to return, and you’ll definitely regret this in five minutes. But hey, you gave them a taste of silence!)
- **`!promote @user (role)`**: Promotes a user to a specified role. (Good luck explaining that to the ones who thought they had power; this should be entertaining. Get the popcorn ready!)
- **`!demote @user (role)`**: Demotes a user from a specified role. (Because they were never fit to wear that crown, anyway. Better luck next time—just don’t cry about it in the public chat.)
- **`!chanpro @user (CHANNELID)`**: Sets a user as channel producer. (For those rare souls who might actually know what they’re doing—don’t get your hopes up. They’ll probably just mess it up spectacularly.)
- **`!depro @user (CHANNELID)`**: Removes a user as channel producer. (No hard feelings… until the next server meeting, where we’ll discuss your incompetence. Good luck with that!)
- **`!lock (CHANNELID)`**: Locks a channel. (Perfect for when the chatter gets too ridiculous—like watching a train wreck you can’t look away from. Sometimes you just need to hit pause on the chaos.)
- **`!unlock (CHANNELID)`**: Unlocks a channel. (Let the madness resume! You’ve made your bed; now lie in it. Good luck with that!)
- **`!message (your_content)`**: Sends a message as OGMelodii. (Because you need someone to say the things you can’t, like reminding your friend they still owe you money. It’s all about maintaining those crucial social contracts.)

## Installation

Installing this bot is as easy as ignoring the pleas of Discord mods trying to enforce rules nobody cares about. Just follow these steps: 

1. **Download the bot files** from the repository (you know how to do that, right?).
2. **Run the setup script** and watch it install like magic—assuming you remember how to run scripts and don’t accidentally delete your entire server in the process. We believe in you… kind of.
3. **Configure the settings** according to your needs. This step requires some thought, so good luck with that—no pressure!
4. **Add the bot to your server** and watch as it transforms your server into a semi-organized chaos arena where nobody knows what’s going on but everyone pretends to.

So, if you’re ready to embrace the madness and finally kick those annoying users to the curb without lifting a finger (well, maybe just a finger), keep an eye out for the "What Did You Expect?" bot! It’s coming soon—who knows when, but definitely before the next apocalypse!
